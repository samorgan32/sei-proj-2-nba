### Description:
The app is an NBA player reference that pulls data from the Ball Don't Lie Api.  Users can search for two specific players and then compare their season averages for the listed statistic.  The goal is to provide a fast and efficient means of evaluating two players in relation to each other.  As of now, all season averages are for the 2020 NBA season.
